# 🌟 Hello, I'm Mani! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  
I'm just someone who loves building cool things, learning new stuff, and leaving bits of myself in every project I touch 💻✨

Whether you're here to browse, get inspired, or just stumbled in — I'm glad you came by!  
Every line of code is a piece of a bigger journey, and maybe, just maybe, our paths will cross again 🛤️

Thanks for visiting — take care, and happy coding! 💙
